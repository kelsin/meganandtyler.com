<h2>Guest Information</h2><h3 id="information-for-the-yacht-club">Information for the Yacht Club</h3>
<p>The Charleston Yacht Club is located in the City Marina in the downtown area. Our ceremony will be held on their deck with the reception to follow in the Flag room. The Yacht Club is close to many hotels and attractions in the downtown area. Due to the nature of the Marina there will be a charge for parking at the Yacht Club. It is a $10 flat rate. We highly suggest that guests either take a cab, uber or carpool to the venue in order to avoid the parking fee.</p>

<h3 id="information-about-hotel-rooms">Information about Hotel rooms</h3>
<p>We have blocked off rooms at three different hotels to give our guests choices and different price points. Both the Holiday Inn Express Downtown and The Hyatt Place (Charleston/Historic District)  are within 2 miles of the Yacht Club. You will be able to enjoy the beautiful and historic downtown Charleston while being close enough to walk, taxi or uber to the venue. Since Charleston is a vacation destination in the spring time we suggest you book your room as soon as possible using our room blocks to ensure you get the best price possible. If you are looking for something a little more budget friendly we have also blocked a set of rooms off at the Holiday Inn Express and Suites at Ashley Phosphate. This hotel is located about 20 minutes from the Yacht Club.</p>
